# Epic 005 - Voice and Multimodal Intake

## Status

- `id`: `epic_005`
- `type`: epic ticket
- `state`: `planned`
- `goal`: support Telegram voice input and transcription as first-class inbound communication.

## Why

Voice input is a required interaction mode and should flow through the same secure, auditable session pipeline as text.

## Delivery Plan (Deployable Tickets)

1. `ticket_001`: Voice media intake, limits, and secure download.
2. `ticket_002`: Transcription adapter and transcript-to-inbound bridge.

## Notes

- This epic supersedes old `pm/epic_001/ticket_011`.
