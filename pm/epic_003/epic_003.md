# Epic 003 - Proactive Actions and Approval-Governed Automation

## Status

- `id`: `epic_003`
- `type`: epic ticket
- `state`: `planned`
- `goal`: deliver proactive execution logic that can recommend and queue actions safely, with explicit approval gates for write operations.

## Why

After scheduler infrastructure exists, Otto needs safe proactive intelligence that can act, but never bypass approval policy.

## Delivery Plan (Deployable Tickets)

1. `ticket_001`: Approval workflow state machine and Telegram approval UX.
2. `ticket_002`: Proactive evaluator for due tasks and tool-driven action emission.
3. `ticket_003`: External reconciliation adapters (Google Tasks) for completion awareness.

## Notes

- This epic supersedes old `pm/epic_001/ticket_007`, `ticket_008`, and `ticket_009`.
